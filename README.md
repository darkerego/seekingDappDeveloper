I need someone to help me write the frontend for a DAPP!


<p>
I am looking for someone that can help me write a simple web front end for a Decentralized Application (aka DAPP). I already have written all of the 
Solidity code for the smart contracts, and now I need a web frontend. I don't care what you write it in.
</p>

<p>
I don't want to put the details of the project here, because I think that it is a good idea that may end up being worth a lot of money and I don't 
want to give it away. But if you are interested in helping, I will discuss it with you. 
</p>

<p>
I am willing to pay to get this developed. I don't anticipate it to be a whole lot of work, and I could probably do it myself, but I just 
hate doing web design. If you are intersted, please find me on telegram: @chev603
